# Founding Engineer – Embedded Systems Engineering

**Location:** In-person, San Francisco (Relocation Supported)
**Type:** Full-time | Competitive Pay + Equity
**Start Date:** ASAP

---

## What You’ll Build

* Deploy compact, low-latency AI models on edge devices under severe resource constraints
* Engineer real-time inference across heterogeneous environments: ARM, RISC-V, x86, and mobile-class platforms 
* Optimize model execution pipelines across CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, custom silicon
* Build embedded runtime systems for degraded, disconnected, and contested environments
* Develop intelligent, performance-aware agents with tight control loops and minimal overhead
* Collaborate closely with the founding team to define our low-SWaP infrastructure and core product direction

---

## What You Bring

* 3+ years in embedded systems or systems-level software
* Strong C/C++, Rust, Python skills
* Experience deploying AI inference on edge hardware (e.g. TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, TVM, Apple Neural Engine, or Metal)
* Familiarity with quantization, pruning, & distillation of models for real-time edge execution
* Knowledge of model compression frameworks (e.g. PyTorch Lightning, Hugging Face Optimum, TensorFlow Model Optimization)
* Experience with real-time OS (e.g. FreeRTOS, Zephyr) and direct hardware access
* Comfort working across memory constraints, volatile compute environments, and secure firmware deployments
* Exposure to edge deployment environments such as macOS (M1/M2), embedded Linux, and secure radios

---

## Bonus Points

* Prior work with over-the-air model updates or remote inference in disconnected networks
* Familiarity with DSPs, SDRs, or custom ASICs
* Kernel-bypass networking (DPDK, eBPF) in embedded or mobile contexts
* Background in national defense systems, aerospace, or robotics
* Strong understanding of secure boot, firmware verification, or TPM-backed deployments

## Why Cosmic Labs

We’re rethinking how machines communicate—from the edge up. Today's networks weren’t designed for autonomous agents, disconnected inference, and high-performance coordination.
It’s a ground-up redesign of how data moves. If you’re obsessed with performance, control, and building intelligent software close to the hardware, we want to meet you.
